# Sorting Algorithms
TODO

## Todos
- [ ] Writeup README
- [ ] UI: Center Buttons
- [ ] UI: Add slider for Array Count + Reload on change
- [ ] Check all `TODO (classification)` Comments - some situations in the sorting algos probably need additional functionality in `observableArray`. This is just to make sure the displayed "stats" are correct.
- [ ] Find a way to pass current settings to "reload"
- [ ] In the delay slider callback, set animation time to 0.05, if the smallest delay is selected. Otherwise use the default, pretty looking 0.1

## Usage
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run start`
